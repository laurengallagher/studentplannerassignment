Student ID: 20080690

Description: This is a simple app so far, it is a student planner app for students to be able to make a note of what they are are studying and when they are studying.
I also put in map so they could even keep track of where they are studying. You can also add an image to distinguish between the subjects.
The CRUD is fully working, you can create, read, update and delete.
